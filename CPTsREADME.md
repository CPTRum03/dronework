this read me is just to explain what I have added on to the code 
the parts I have added are the pymavlink function and the SITL connection to actually make sure that the drone sim is running and accepting commands from my hand gestures. I have also commented out unnecessary stuff like point history and gesture identificaion which prints out what its identified as it would strain the raspi too much, if put on a raspi, they obviously can be uncommented as per your wishes. the UDP port used is a garbage value make sure to switch it when running your simulation.
like I have mentioned previously the only changes I made were the py mavlink and SITL most of the code is still the same apart from a few minor changes here and there. the actual handgesture code was taken from kinivi's mediapipe hand recog model which is an english translation of the japanese model of the same name
Kinivi's read me is also present in the main file that I have committed for more details on the code do go through it
